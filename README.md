Challenges: Planning out the 4 timers and when each timer would run with what conditions & the power up and having 2 timers for the power up

Did not Accomplish: Fixes the glitches/flickering when the transparent pictureboxes collide. I did research and learned that with Visual Studios it is not possible to fix it unless you draw your own pictures.

Learned Skills: Boundaries/Intersecting objects, Full Screen mode with the borders, and adding audio with loop
